# Build this image before running docker-compose (or just run it anyway to pull it from Docker Hub)
#
# This composition starts a 2 VMs scenario with a third VM working as an ansible controller, but also uses the current user's ssh keys to do passwordless logins on all of them.
#
# docker-compose -f docker-compose-key.yml up -d
#
# To log into the controller VM just type (password should NOT be asked):
#
# export PUBLICKEY=`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
# ssh -p 2200 user@localhost
#
